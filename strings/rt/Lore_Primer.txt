		<summary><strong> Solaros' Grand Domain </strong></summary>
		<br>
		<em>The Suns Own</em>
		<br><br>
		Located in the southern part of Hearthshire, Solaros' Grand Domain is arguably the single most powerful political entity in the known world. Almost all peoples use the Solar Calendar, canonized by the Sunlight Temple during the year 0SC, and the Trimvirate Pantheon is widely considered to be the 'defacto' religion of the Three Continents. The people of Solaros' Grand Domain are known to be steadfast, loyal, and deeply faithful to their patrons and their people. It is one of the most diverse factions within the Three Continents, and in spite of being founded by Humans during the times before the Solar Calender, Humans no longer remain the majority figure within the Domain. Its notable tolerance towards all people of all walks of life, and good standard of living for even the lowest class, makes it the most popular migrational destination to anyone seeking a new life. With the end of the Fourth Solarian/Grenzelhoftian War, Solaros' Grand Domain found itself rebuilding most of its more northern territories, a process which has taken up most of its concerns for the past few years.
		<br><br>
		The Grand Domain's prominence was built from tactical allyship, and a willingness to embrace industrialization. Through close cooperation with Stonekeep, railways have connected almost the entirety of Grand Domain lands to one another, allowing for unprecedented connection and reach between its peoples. It holds both a deep friendship with the Dwarves of Stonekeep, and additional friendship with many of the Isle City States. Its main god is Sol, but worship of every diety of the Pantheon is welcomed within the Domain. Its capital is located within the shores of the Bay of Stars. People from Solaros' Grand Domain are generally called Solaros' People, or Domainers.

	<details>
		<summary><strong> The City States </strong></summary>
		<br>
		<em>Land of Riches, the Isle City States, the Pulse of the Continents</em>
		<br><br>
		The City States are not a single political entity, but rather a collection of independent republics which span the large islands broken off from the Bay of Stars, in what many believe to have been a star landing upon Terra some thousands of years ago. These republics, while nominally working together with one another, have had their fair share of spats, skirmishes, and otherwise blood disagreements in the many years of their existence. However no quarrel lasts long, and the City States are broadly considered to be a single entity within the political spectrum. Many isles with which the city states reside rest in the center of the straits which seperate the three continents. This has made the City States the global center for trade and commerce between all factions, while also making it a cultural, intellectual, and artistic powerhouse. 
		<br><br>
		The City States have had the good fortune of being able to profit off of nearby wars without ever taking part of them due to their impressive array of Mercenaries. All City States field a number of Pavise Crossbowmen, which have long been a staple purchase for Domainer Armies seeking to augment their ranged capabilities. Espardo Duelists, Silucian Sergeants, and Veronian Montate are all hired individually as bodyguards or as small groups to augment armies. There is no singular god worshiped above any other within the City States. People from the City States are usually called City Staters, Statesmen, or Republicans. Some may also be called by their individual City State name, such as Esparian, Deonian, or Veronian.

		<summary><strong> Grenzelhoft Empire </strong></summary>
		<br>
		<em>The Black Empire, The Empty Throne, Empire of War</em>
		<br><br>
		Grenzelhoft is an imperialist state carved across the center of Hearthshire, from coast to coast. Its founding is shrouded in mystery, and nobody knows the true story of what brought about the Black Empire. What isn't under doubt however, is the sheer force of might Grenzelhoft fields within its lands. Grenzelhoft is a military empire where the rule is passed down not to sons or daughters, but to the General most deserving to oversee the Empire. All individuals who come of age are required to spend at least two years in service of either their local county militia, or within one of its many Free Companies. This has led Grenzelhoft to field the largest and most professional armies within the world, having defeated every neighbor they have at least once prior, including the Dukedom of Camrey, the Kingdom of Helmsmore, and Solaros' Grand Domain.
		<br><br>
		Grenzelhoftians proudly assimilate all willing to come and serve, cultures and religions mean little to the Black Empire besides your physical capabilites. No matter whom you worship or where you come from, with a blade in your hand you'll be welcome to the Grenzelhoftian cause. Their history is defined by war, death, and destruction, for their armies are known to give no mercy. Ilia, Goddess of War and Fertility, is their main god, and in spite of their tolerance towards all religions, worship of Sol can find one with a sideways glance given their long history with Solaros' Grand Domain.
		<br><br>
		With the end of the 4th Solarian/Grenzelhoftian war, Grenzelhoft has had been rebuilding some of its southern territories, and recovering from the loss of their Emperor and many of their highest generals due to the last battle of the war, which saw them wiped from the fields of the Grand Domain by an inferior force due to tactics never seen before. While the war was generally considered a stalemate, the bitter sting of the final defeat hasn't left the hearts of the nobility, and while most of the Free Companies move to offer their services as Mercenaries elsewhere, some consider it only a matter of time before war falls upon the Black Empire once more.

		<summary><strong> Wilusian Dynasty </strong></summary>
		<br>
		<em>The Breadbasket of Alur, Empire of the Rivers, Merchants of the Pasha</em>
		<br><br>
		A grand-spanning, mercantilist empire which found prosperity and riches from both spice and food. Wilusia resides almost entirely within the confines of the Torki River's wide reach, yet there could be no more suitable a place to live than the most fertile lands in the known world. Within their land lies great feats of engineering, and grand artistic displays prominently shown within any of its myriad of villages and towns along the river.
		<br><br>
		Wilusia has suffered repeated attempts by others, namely Grenzelhoft and the Grand Domain, to conquer its lands and aquire its many riches and materials, yet no exterior force has ever been able to defeat its capital, Fenkhu, in spite of Grenzelhoft having put it to siege for over seven years. In spite of City State mercenaries having been a part of many of these wars, Wilusia maintains good relations with the City States, whom are their main middle man to the wider Hearthshire kingdoms.
		<br><br>
		Wilusians worship a wide variety of gods, mainly Hixis, Gendeni, and Xylic. Wilusia also has a large following of Terra Worshipers. Primarily a Human Empire, it is no less home to just about every race in the known world, albeit not as abundantly as Solaros' Grand Domain. While known for its vast lands and many villages, it is also known to allow for legal slavery, albeit this practice is not widely used within its cities and is generally left mostly to the smaller villages. It is seen mostly as either a punishment for a crime, or as a means to payback debt. People from the Wilusian Dynasty are simply known as Wilusians.

		<summary><strong> The Ogri Union</strong></summary>
		<br>
		<em>Union of the Plains, Gendeni's Own, Those in Graggars Shadows</em>
		<br><br>
		The Ogri Union is a coalition consisting of tribes of Orcs, Goblins, and Plains Dwarves who formed together after the ascension of Graggar. The devastation left behind by the god deeply shook the faith of the once proudly worshiping Orcish peoples, and a massive civil war saw the destruction of almost half of the Orcish and Goblin tribes. In the ashes of what was the most violent war on the continent, a Warlord and the tribes under her sought to rebuild their lands from the ground up to ensure that an ascension in the likes of Graggar never happened again. Aided by the Plains Dwarves, and an Adventurer from the City States who would come to have a profound impact on the future government the new Union would become, the Orcs and Goblins salvaged their ravaged lands and turned it into a prosperous empire. 
		<br><br>
		The Orgi Union is governed by a council of representatives voted upon by each town, village, and city among the plains, who all get one represenative to have a seat on the council. The council then votes upon a Chieftain who is broadly just a figurehead for the people of the Union. The Ogri Union is most notable for having no real commerce outside of interactions with other empires, as Food, Water, and Shelter are regarded as basic rights for all peoples. All transactions are either barters, favors, or simply good deeds done to assist in one another.
		<br><br>
		The people of the Ogri union mainly consist of Orcs, Goblins, and Plains Dwarves, with very few peoples otherwise. They are unique for using blimps and zeppelins to navigate the immensely harsh terrain of the Denor Plains. Ever since the ascension of Graggar, many have rejected gods as worthy of worship, and thus Terran Worship is the major religion within the Union. Gendeni is the only generally respected god besides that, and secret Graggar cults still reside within the plains. People from the Ogri Union are usually just called by their race, but some people call them Denorians, Ogrians, or Unioners.

		A Kingdom residing to the northeast of Hearthshire, the Helmsmore family has ruled for over five hundred years and have weathered many a storm coming their way. In spite of their smaller size compared to all of their neighbors, their capital of Rosewood is one of the most technologically advanced places in the world, eclipsing even that of Solaros' Grand Domain. Their strong guild of artificers, and vast library of knowledge makes it an attractive land for scholars and intellectuals.

The Dukedom is ruled by a council of every single Duke within the lands, albeit this council can vary greatly as noble families rise and fall, and an exact count is never truly gleaned between meetings. They maintain a strict serfdom over their peoples in what looks like sheer slavery to most outsiders.

		Located underneath Taggarth Mountains, Stonekeep is the capital and throng of the Mountain Dwarves and Gnomes. Their technological advancements have paved the way for many new inventions, and their close friendship with Solaros' Grand Domain has brought them into conflict with other Empires at multiple points. They've constructed most of the underground railways connecting most of Subterra, albeit their attempts to build them connecting to other continents have been thwarted by the Dark Elves, their greatest rivals. Their largest railway spans from Stonekeep in Southern Hearthshire, to Rosewood in Northern Heartshire. Malum is their god of worship.

		Spontaneous fortresses and towns of Crimsonland origin, established via nomadic means. These encampments take advantage of natural resources and nearby settlements to raid, conquer, consume, and then move on to more promising targets. They are ever-moving hordes of gluttony and rage which constantly follow a pattern of great loss followed by a steady regrowth. Most of these forces are still recovering from the most recent Goblin War.
		<br><br>
		A misogynistic and self-destructive culture to its extreme, scholars report that several terms of language have been developed just to describe masculinity. Any sane individual loses focus after an orc rambles about &Sigma;-class masculinity or whatever newest scam Graggarspawn have begun pushing. Records are sparse as a result.

		<i><span style="display:block; color:#dfe6ba; font-size:120%"> "Please, darling. The world aaaalways needs more DRAMA!"</span></i>
		<br>
		Diety of trickery, freedom, and inspiration. Their domain encompasses friendly pranks, barding, theatre, and performance. Known widely to be genderless, as they see such concepts only as masks to play a role. They were crafted from the tongue of Psydon.
		<br><br>
		Of all The Ten, Xylix is considered the most 'problem child.' Whether spats with Astrata over freedom, or making trouble for its own sake, they're something of an outcast from the orderly nature of the rest- and they are perfectly content with their position. For Xylixians, a boring life is not one worth living.

		<br>
		Goddess of disease, alchemy, and medicine. Her domain encompasses all cycles of change; from rot and decay to refinement and transformation. The domain of alchemy is a subject of dispute between Pestra and Noc frustratingly often for her taste, but she retains firm hold. She was a mistake, slithering out of Psydon's intestines left behind.
		<br><br>
		Despite closeness with Astrata, Pestra remains something of an outcast amongst The Ten due to her accidental origin. Her Great Insult of rebuffal towards Eora only further damaged ties, though Pestra thrives in her isolation. To her, it's simply less chains restraining experimentation.

		<i><span style="display:block; color:#5a53d5; font-size:125%"> "Allow me serenity for once, child. A brief respite. Calamity surely strikes again soon..." </span></i>
		<br>
		Goddess of death and time. Once a close partner to Psydon. She was the first mortal, the first to die, and the second to achieve godhood. Her domain encompasses passing spirits, the underworld, and the cycle of reincarnation. She created the other Nine from her butchery of Psydon.
		<br><br>
		Necra is most controversial amongst The Ten. She is reviled for her butchery and perceived betrayal of Psydon by those faithful to Him, yet is defended by Tennites across the land claiming she acted out of necessity. The exact circumstances of Psydon's death are unclear, but Necra is surely responsible- and she makes no effort to hide it.

		God of thievery, ill-gotten gains, and highwaymen. A figure shrouded in mystery. While assumed to once have been humen, there are no records of his appearance. His very feats were spread by word-of-mouth and rumour, with little ties to any tangible figure. He was the first of The Four to ascend.
		<br><br>
		Matthios is used as a figurehead by bandits and oppressed peasants alike. While his exact beliefs are unknown, his hatred for nobility specifically is apparent. He would quench his insatiable greed with their coffers over most others. He is hailed as a figure of rebellion, of freedom similar to Xylix who resonates with those who've felt abandoned by The Ten.
		<br><br>
		Upon his ascension, an otherworldly tomb's entrances began appearing around the world. The Tomb of Matthios promised riches, rewards, but equal danger. Most who enter only manage to join his collection, or fall victim to the roaming bands of orcs and goblins within.

		<br>
		Goddess of drugs, self-preservation, and remorseless Joy. The first tiefling; an 'exotic' consort-turned-regent whose self-indulgence sent her once-thriving kingdom careening into ruin. She preaches "Joy at all costs!" to her followers. She was the second of The Four to ascend.
		<br><br>
		A Baothan follower is unmistakable. Brightly-dyed hair to make Eora weep, ridiculous slang to make listeners' ears bleed, a taste in music that's out-of-this-world, and sobriety, of course, a foreign concept. The status quo exists to be subverted. Only through rebellious joy is this failing world worth living... there's no use trying to save it.
		<br><br>
		Baotha's ascension marked the spread of her kind, tieflings, across Psydonia. The anomaly became a species all at once, in an event known as The Hellspawn Scourge. Her voice began to whisper in the ears of drunkards, addicts, and the hopeless- preaching not a better future, but a bliss to distract oneself from it.

		God of unnatural beasts, unsated consumption, and unbridled hatred. Known as the Dark Sini-Star to faithful and foes alike. The first orc, a warlord notorious for consuming fallen opponents in ritualistic feasting. He was the third of The Four to ascend.
		<br><br>
		Followers of Graggar put women in their place. Graggarism is a culture built on strength, misogyny, and glee in the destruction or corruption of what exists. It's an addictive, never-ending hunger of flesh, gorging until one's skin turns green and they sprout tusks. Resist the cravings as long as you can, fool. They consume all.
		<br><br>
		Eora took pity upon Graggar as he ascended, extending some of her own divinity in attempt to heal the man she foolishly thought she could 'fix.' Graggar was gracious, of course, as he crafted with this sliver hordes of goblins and outlandish monsters to terrorize Psydonia for eternity onwards. He cackles about her naivety to this day.

		<br>
		Goddess of forbidden magicks, domination, and power. A snow-elven lich who achieved godhood through the sacrifice of her entire people. She conquered the dark elven empire, reshaping it violently into the evil it stands today. She was the final mortal to ascend... for now.
		<br><br>
		Followers of Zizo put men in their place. Zizonic culture is a misandristic terror of back-stabbing and plots in the shadows. None are safe from betrayal in order to secure a position to serve The Queen. Avid practitioners of fleshcrafting and subverters of Noc's Arcyne, Zizonians believe that magick should be available to all with the drive to stand up and <em>take it.</em>
		<br><br>
		Necra's millennium-spanning rules of life and death were all but shattered upon Zizo's ascension. Corpses no longer lied to rest, instead emerging after several minutes to walk and feast again on the living, spreading their curse of death. The deadite plague was the most impactful calamity to ever strike Psydonia. Society was only barely able to adapt and move forward with their new reality, and could not aid the dark elven empire in their defense against the lich queen's armies.

		Humens come from a vast swathe of cultures and ethnicities all around Psydonia, most of which have historically been at odds with both one another and other species. With their tenacity and overwhelming population, humens tend to outnumber the other species drastically. Their saturation leads to most world maps representing humen borders and states over other species'.

		<br>
		Elves, created by Necra to guide humenity, are characterized by lengthened age, low fertility, and a magical aptitude originating from a vast array of tribal cultures. With the ascension of Zizo, the entire culture of snow-elves was all but destroyed, leading the remaining tribes to live in fear and paranoia of suffering the same fate. Many elves sought safety through mixing culture, positioning themselves under the watchful guard of their stronger humen counterparts. A longstanding feud remains between elves and dwarves. Elvenkind has yet to forgive the dwarves for their destruction of homeland and pillaging of natural resources within the former snow-elf territory. To elves, it was the greatest disrespect to those lost.

		The child of an Elf and a Humen. Half-Elves are generally frowned upon by more conservative peoples, although as species tensions lower, more and more half-elves are being born- to the point that some scholars worry someday it may be impossible to distinguish the two species. Half-Elves are extraordinarily diverse, as they combine both Humen and Elvish culture. It is widely considered that Half-Elf culture is simply a melting pot of various others condensing into one vibrant entity. With their longevity spanning too long for a human and too short for an elf, they tend to congregate together. Depending on their heritage, Half-Elves tend to gain species traits depending on how strong their fathers, or mothers, genes were. Half-Elves typically struggle to find their own identity.

A proud and robust species of vertically challenged folk, dwarves are known for their martial strength and their tenacity towards their ancient customs of craft and honour. Dwarves hold a strong alliance with humenkind and have done so throughout history, as was their original purpose decreed by Psydon. A Dwarf, much like the rock that they carve their fortress out of, is stubborn and ancient. They are revered craftsmen, sculptors, smiths, and miners. As an old and mostly out-of-date saying goes, "If you want it done right, lose 2 feet and grow a beard." Despite their cultural praise, a long-standing feud remains between dwarves and elves stemming from old industrial practices.

Many an aasimar will detest the reverence in which they are greeted with, for their greatest failure or unuse that lead to their discarding is not subject for celebration. An aasimar may be crafted with any number of materials. Many resemble sculptures of stone or are ceramic in skin, but their insides are just as mortal as any other. Most Aasimar were created to serve The Ten, and few if any Psydonic Aasimar remain to this day- decrepit husks of what were once great warriors.

	<br><br>

	<details>
		<summary><strong> Tritons </strong></summary>
		<br>
		The Children of Abyssor, also known as Tritons or their colloquial name, "Deep Folk,"  are a strange species of people that live under the waves of Psydonia. Born from creatures of the deep with Abyssor's guidance, these aquatic wayfarers all share a few common traits.
		<br><br>
		Similar to other creatures that dwell below the surface, their eyes are dull with disuse. Tritons feel pain when gazing upon that which direct light of Astrata herself illuminates.
		<br><br>
		 Unlike most of the people of Psydonia, their culture is often considered cold and dour; an apathetic attitude to most negative or positive news. For them, the depths of Psydonia's oceans are cold and unforgiving. Large beasts travel the waters that swallow their kin whole...  but the crushing depths have provided them a hearty disposition and resistance to most threats. Born of Abyssor, their normally placid emotions can swing into a wild rage when they view injustice done upon their kin at the hands of a sapient being.
		 <br><br>
		 Tritons seen on the surface are very important trade partners, mercenaries, and surprising academics.  Merchants often spend vast amounts of coin to have them aboard their trade vessels, fending off pirates or guiding their boats through turbulent weather. Be it on or within the sea, they excel- on land, however, they struggle. With their awkward and gangly fins, long, sharp talons, ghastly, lipless teeth, and milky, foreign eyes, they seem unfit to walk amongst the people. Humen children are often afraid of them due to such appearances.
		 <br><br>
		 Their species is not without its tribalism, however. Large sections of their kin have broken away form their father,  to consider themselves Noc's chosen. Due to their extreme sexual dimorphism similar to that of the common angler, males of this species are more likely to pursue magick with their weaker frames compared to their stronger female counterparts.

		<summary><strong> Medicators / "Feculents" </strong></summary>
		<br>
		Medicators originate from the the fetid swamps and murk within the Isle of Enigma. Their species has historically been localized around the area, although the Brass Cataclysm of Heartfelt's fall has resulted in droves of their kind seeking refuge elsewhere. They are a newer form of sapience, with records dating back only after Zizo's ascension.
		<br><br>
		Their appearance is gaunt, patches of bare skin riddled with feathers and pox scars, Medicators are a horrifying fusion of bird and men- unlike their far more appealing adversaries, the harpies. With long, hanging beaks which clatter as they breathe, other species find them displeasing at best and repulsive at worst. Despite this, their eyes betray great intelligence behind otherwise monstrosity.
		<br><br>
		Born of carcinogens, pollution, mechanical and biological waste, these creatures were not always sapient. Through their appearance, accidental origin, and innate sicknesses, they have gained the fascination and uplifting of Pestra and inherited aspects of the serpentine goddess in turn. Medicators, as they called themselves, carry with them the bedside manners, or lack thereof, of the worst Pestrans. Their culture holds discovery and medicinal breakthroughs in the highest regard, be it through experimentation to shift their own ailments or others'. Medicators care little about the nickname granted to them by other species, 'feculents,' so long as their medical prowess is not subject to question.

		Medicators and Harpies often find themselves in conflict, mirroring the quarrels of their patrons, whether of conscious faith or not.

		<summary><strong> Harpies </strong></summary>
		<br>
		Harpies, or less ceremoniously known as 'magpies,' resemble the despised hollow-kin in appearance at first glance. One would rightfully assume they are similar in nature- with accuracy even, much to the harpies' chagrin. Harpies have been uplifted and reconnected to divinity by Eora, having developed culture of music and song which caught the attention of such a goddess. Their songs and voices may be their own, or proud mimicking other voices they've heard with unnatural accuracy.
		<br><br>
		Whilst harpies may fly, their freedom is weighed by corruption of fleshcrafting to this day. Complete open-air freedom is still foreign to them. Harpies tend to live and gather in colonies at the tops of great sequoia forests and in nearby cliffs. Due to their laden flight, they must employ use of updrafts and proximity to large objects or structures to bolster their limited range and air-dancing performances. Their serene songs and blissful music can be heard echoing far below, guiding travelers and thieves both to respite... or treasure. For as lifted into grace as they might be, these 'magpies' earn such a nickname from instinctual Matthiosan greed and love for anything that shines. Yet if one can work past that distrust and compensate them well, harpies make for unparalleled couriers.

		<br>
		Also known as Infernal-Spawn, Hell-Bloods, Surface-Devils, and perhaps in a more humorous manner, <em>thief</em>-lings. Their treatment ranges from shunning to distrust, depending on the region. Shopkeeps and merchants always keep a wary eye on any tiefling passersby. The resentment feed into itself, leading to higher rates of tiefling ire and thievery against other species. Many tieflings resign to seeking a solitary and nomadic life, huddled in groups outside the watchful eyes of others. They also tend to be extremely perceptive and paranoid, as luck is rarely on their side.
		<br><br>
		Tieflings began appearing all over Psydonia after Baotha's ascension within the 21st century, and were exiled in droves as the world adapted. They are often mistaken as being related to her.
		<br><br>
		Tieflings are incapable of reproducing with mortals, and thus are spawn of either devils, demons, or other tieflings. A tiefling may develop any number of hellish features, a wide range of horns, potential hooves, odd spines and spikes, or scales. Oddly positioned scales, hollow bones, and other varying oddities that appear consistently in tiefling biology make them considerably fragile. It is not uncommon for a tiefling to be generally unpleasant to look at in the eye of the commonfolk. As if to make matters worse, their hellish progenitors have left them a destiny of misfortune, though perhaps their immunity to fire opens new opportunities for them...

		<br>
		The child of a dark elf and humen. The distinction between half-elves and 'half-drow' has been a subject of debate for centuries. While similar in physicality and longevity to their non-drow cousins, their origins cause them to face discrimination akin to their elven side. Groups of half-elves and half-drow have been known to congregate together and consider themselves one species. According to some radical academic scholars, they might be one and the same species indeed- yet the people of Psydonia certainly do not believe the same at large.

		<summary><strong> Dark-elves </strong></summary>
		<br>
		Zizo's conquered. These elves hail from an underground expanse of newly-reborn empires.  They lead harsh, matriarchal lives under the watchful gaze of Zizo, the vast majority hoping to one day achieve such power and domination for themselves.
		<br><br>
		Zizo's spawn, the last snow elves, integrated themselves- whether gleefully or resentfully- within the dark elf culture their grandmother had carved through conquest.
		<br><br>
		To most in Psydonia, a dark elf is nothing more than a servant of Zizo waiting to betray for power, leading most dark elves to remain within their safe underground strongholds. Those who breach the surface rarely receive fair treatment. Dark elves over 500 years old may remember their Ravoxian empire of old, yet few remain who were not killed or converted.

		<summary><strong> Half-orcs </strong></summary>

		The bastards of Graggar. Half-orcs are the offspring of orcs and another species, half-orcs, or another species who has consumed much kinsflesh on their way to orcishness.  An outsider cannot tell a half-orc product of heritage or cannibalism at a glance, leading to much social ostracization.
		<br><br>
		Due to their parent's refusal to nurture them, as well as their other parent often rejecting or attacking them, most half-orcs will grow as orphans. Their rejection by the rest of society causes their growth to stunt, often making them hostile and prone to violence. Because of this, most will assume the worst in them, believing that they are cursed to follow their orcish parent's footsteps in the gorging of kin-flesh.

		<summary><strong> Hollowkin </strong></summary>
		<br>
		Hollowkin are short lived, widely diverse, and have an insatiable hatred for dark elves. This hate stems from their long standing political neighbor and rival, the Zizonic dark-elven kingdoms of Subterra. Dendor and Xylix stand as the 'patron-deities' of this species despite having no hand in their creation. Hollowkin view freedom to be of the upmost importance due to their dark-elven neighbors' tendencies toward slavery and their own history of subjugation. They also, often mistakenly, worship Dendor for the boon of their animalistic nature, perceiving him as the source of their traits, talents, and instinct.
		<br><br>
		Their true origin is much darker. Hollowkin are the product of dark-elven ingenuity and fleshcrafting. Their creation is a simple story of malice and greed- of sapient animal hybrid slave homunculi, a person turned product which they could market and sell to other great houses of modern Zizonic Subterra. The true nature of their existence is largely lost to the hollowkin through centuries. The dark elves still recall, of course, viciously mocking their creations from deep within their caves, declaring them but nothing more than animals or pets. Hollowkin react violently to dark-elven attempts at oppression, this leads to conflicts across the world of Psydonia.
		<br><br>
		 To the unaligned observer, hollowkin are often seen amongst bandit bands, working openly with Agents of Matthios, conflating the idea of freedom between the two deities. There is, of course, the old wives' tales that circulate... how hollowkin lead to infestations of Werewolves. Whether this is true or not is unknown to the common person, but to those familiar with the horrendous magics used by the dark elves, they must only assume the worst.

They are often found in servitude to great beasts such as dragons and giants - trapping their lairs and utilizing pack tactics to dispose of ambitious adventurers and thieves alike. But in their lonesome, Kobolds are generally weak and quick to die, as they noticeably lack the meaningful amount of constitution, strength, and endurance that other species usually have.

Her tastes and demands for increasingly exotic substances further doomed her kingdom day after day, until the once thriving azure coasts held nothing but memories of struggle and suffering.
		<br><br>
		Nobility and peasantry cheered alike when word spread of her death. Overdose of Lux, they said. A blight across the lands lifted... or so was thought. Her dark whispers reached more and more ears, of drunkards, the miserable, offering a false salvation of escape.

Parents across Psydonia birthed, hatched, or otherwise found unexpected surprises of hell-tainted children bearing half their features. Most hadn't the slightest explanation to this. Many blamed the influence of recently-ascended Baotha, yet the new goddess seemed insistent to deny that out of any aspect of her life.

		After rejection and expulsion from nation after nation, tiefling culture developed around a nomadic lifestyle. As time passed, some were even allowed to integrate themselves within lower echelons of humen society. Yet all nobility agreed on one aspect; no tiefling would ever preside over a court again, much less allowed the grace of divine noble blood at all.

Graggar, feared by follower and foe alike for his habit of consuming the flesh of his fallen opponents, tore his way through the steppes and forests North of Zaladin, pillaging, destroying, and consuming in endless destruction and gluttony. None were surprised when his exterior grew as monstrous as interior. With feast after feast, conquest after conquest, the first orc's battle cries were soon heard by the heavens themselves, marking him the third mortal to reach ascendance.

		<summary><strong> Goblin War I - 2054 </strong></summary>
		<br>
		A direct product of Eora's naivety, so the stories say. Her offering to Graggar, a sliver of divinity in hopes of easing tensions between the pantheons of old and new, was graciously accepted and used to form barely-sapient monsters of hunger and rage across Psydonia. As with the spreading curse of orcishness, these greenskins under orders of their new god attacked almost every settlement capable of taking records. The attempt at world conquest was crushed after two years of humenity's efforts to resist the calamity proved fruitful.

		<br>
		<em>"I will never forget the night of silver wires. I was sitting around the kampfire alongside the snow elven family who had taken me in. I had grown to konsider them friends, family even, as I studied their ways and kulture. Imagine my horror, as strands of silver light descended from the sky to their hearts, arcing from some unknown origin beyond the horizon. My brief fascination turned to panic as their Lux was violently ripped from each of their hearts, leaving only the gore, bones, and lifeless rred eyes of my former kompanions staining the snow. I kould not save them. No one kould save any of them. Kenturies later, the memories haunt me no less."</em>- Aspen Uki, wood-elven scholar.

		The snow-elven lich Zizo, after having grown in power and isolation for centuries, finally made her move. She forcefully stole the souls of her entire people, sparing only her descendants. Using the sheer power of captured divinity, she took her position as the fourth ascended goddess. As she grew higher and tested the limits of her newfound power, the very rules of death twisted. Corpses everywhere would stand yet again, weighing hunger against the will of their new matriarch.

		A strange comet struck the peak of Malum's Anvil. In its center, a rusted capsule remained, containing a divine, crystalline shard of Astrata's light. The first artificer to touch the shard could not handle the pure divinity, falling to ash. It was successfully contained within Vanderlin, now serving to light the way of travelers.

		<summary><strong> Goblin War II - 2470 </strong></summary>
		<br>
		The most recent 'Goblin War' in the minds of the general populous. Graggar's armies struck with a greater ferocity than ever before, but centuries of preparation led to an overwhelming defeat after five years of viscious and taxing combat. The late 70's were defined by the joy of veterans returning home from the conflict, and the grief of families who'd lost during the carnage.
